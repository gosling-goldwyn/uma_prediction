feat: Enhance prediction scripts and fix CNN prediction issue

- Refactor `predict_latest_race.py` to accept URL arguments and output individual model predictions (probabilities and derived categories).
- Fix `predict_ensemble.py` issues:
    - Resolve `ModuleNotFoundError` by ensuring proper module execution.
    - Address `ValueError` related to categorical features by handling unseen categories.
    - Correct horse name extraction from scraped data.
    - Eliminate `FutureWarning` by ensuring consistent data types for missing historical data.
- Downgrade scikit-learn version to 1.6.1 to resolve `InconsistentVersionWarning`.
- Improve CNN model architecture in `training_utils.py` to address "Others" prediction bias (requires retraining).
- Add `download_models.py` for robust model downloading from Hugging Face Hub.
- Update `README.md` to reflect new features and project structure.
